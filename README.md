# Graph-Based-Recommendation-System-for-Online-Retail-Stores
Recommendation system is a subclass of information filtering system that seeks to predict rating or preferences a user would give to an item. They help a user/customer to make easy decision choices and prefer what would suit best for them. Henceforth, it saves the customer’s time and gives the customer value for money products to be taken into consideration. In this project our main, aim is to recommend a retail store customer to recommend the next best suited product when he/she puts first product in their basket. The study is conducted on “Online Retail Store Dataset” collected from UCI repository. The data was collected for a UK based retail store from 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011. The recommendation system developed for this particular dataset will use graph-based properties to give best product recommendation to the customer. Moreover, we have also used Louvain algorithm to detect communities of the customers who buy products of the similar kind.
